About the Project

This project presents a blockchain-based platform designed to prevent the issuance and validation of fake certificates. The system enables registered users to issue certificates by entering key event details such as the event name, organization, date, and location, followed by uploading the certificate. A unique code is generated for each certificate, which is checked against the blockchain to ensure that it has not been previously issued. This process guarantees that no duplicate certificates are generated for the same event, effectively preventing forgery. The blockchain ensures the authenticity and security of stored certificates, making the verification process transparent and tamper-proof. Through this platform, we aim to enhance trust and integrity in certificate issuance by leveraging blockchainâ€™s decentralized, immutable nature.
